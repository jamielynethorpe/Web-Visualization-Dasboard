## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
 Created a visualizatin dashboard website for the analysis of weather in different cities of the world across the globe.

 ## About

 This is an analysis and visualization of weather of more than 500 randomly chosen cities. The objective was to showcase the relationship of various factors:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
 
 The final notebook included the follolwing items:

*  Analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* Matplotlib and Pandas plotting libraries.
* Descriptions of  observable trends based on the data.
* Labels of  plots which includes aspects: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.

## Observable Trends

* It is a known fact that the temperature increases as we approach the equator, thus making it “hot”. The warmer the temperature reflects the more humid the cities displayed through the two plots (Latitude vs. Temperature and Latitude vs. Humidity). The cooler the temperatures, the lower the humidity.

* The lower temperatures displayed the furthest from the equator, thus making the climate colder as it appears to be the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the Earth’s tilt in the axis or a change in the axial tilt which is known as the obliquity.

* The relationship showing in the City Latitude vs. Wind Speed does not display an overall relationship between the latitude and wind speeds. However, this plot does display some outliers and in the northern hemispheres there are few cities with over 10 (mph) of wind.

* There is no obvious dependence of wind speed on latitude. The wind speed in general is from 0 mph to 15 mph.
